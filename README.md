# Boggle Practice

This React app functions as a single player Boggle game to allow you to practice and get better. After the game, all available words are revealed.

## Motivation

Recently I've been playing the Boggle game from the Play Store while still in our endless quarantine, and I was getting beaten. Badly. So I made an app to generate a Boggle board and tell me what words were present and in theory I was going to look over this list and learn the common words to look for. This got boring and I kept adding features and now it's single-player Boggle that shows you what you missed when the game is over.

## Built with

*[React](https://www.reactjs.org)

## Features

After the game, a list of all possible words appears beneath the game area. Words you found will be highlighted in green. Click on any word to show where the solver found it on the board.

I did not know how to take a text file of a list of words and iterate over it, so the code to do this is taken basically directly from this respository. Also I did look over her app when I got stuck, but I did my best to keep this to a minimum and tried to rely on Google or attempting until I succeeded with problems I encountered. As a result I'm not sure how much her code influenced mine, I'm sure it did some.

I found my list of words here. Disclaimer: I don't know how useful this list actually is for the Boggle app but it's the best I could come up with.
